# I know outbox.h is showing error, idk what's happening
Its got something to do with the way the struct is being called, idk what's the difference between .h file and .cpp file in terms of compiling but this error only seemed to show up in header file and our lord and savior GPT doesn't seem to see it as an issue either.

As of now, I do know that everything is functional as in they can properly communicate but are just very disorganized, with many conflicting function.
